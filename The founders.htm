            <p>Fun in the Sun is a company that sells handmade bracelets. The idea came up when Emma and Alyssa were making bracelets. Soon Emily joined and Alex even started making bracelets too. Every summer, they would make bracelets for themselves. It only made sence to help other people to enjoy their summer vacation with beautiful bracelets too. They continued to make the bracelets, multiple in one day. But they needed a way to get the word out. How was anyone going to know about their comany? Emma was already taking a coding class. She used what she learned to create their very own website. Things were going wonderfully. They took lots of photos and modeled the bracelets. They even had Jack, the cat, model for the front cover.</p>

            <p>The four kids worked to create their many needed bracelets. They worked for weeks building bracelets. While they created, they considered many names for their company. One idea was Multi Cats. But eventually they all agreed on Fun in the Sun. Thinking about what the name meant to them it was their goal for making these bracelest. Summer is undoubtedly one of the best seasons and what better way to spend your summer than wearing your favorite bracelets. Their goal is to make and sell these bracelets so that other people can have the same joy and love for summer. Making bracelets was going well, but anklets started hitting the front page. They went to work designing their new styles and patterns. Each bracelet has a specific pattern. You have to pick the right colors to go with each other. Soon they took their new bracelets + anklets to parks, their backyards, and even their own bedrooms and went to work taking photo after photo. The website was coming along and now they had something to sell. Things were looking up. Even though this summer started out really strange, they made the best of all their free time and have created something wonderful. <br>We hope you enjoy <br> -The SunTeam</p>

                            <p>Hi! My name is Emma. I love to draw and create. Making bracelets is so much fun and designing the website is even better. I love working with Alex, Emily, and Alyssa. They are so much fun. In my free time I am playing with my two dogs, Buster and Ranger, taking photos with our camera, or painting. I love to read and I am currently reading the Warriors cat series (Emily and Alyssa suggested it). When I grow up, I want to work for NASA. I have a poster in my room of the Apollo 11 astronauts. I would love to be an astronaut, but working on the rockets would be awesome too. I have had so much fun working with the others on this website and I hope you enjoy it too!</p>
